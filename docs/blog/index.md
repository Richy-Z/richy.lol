## Writing is a powerful tool!

After having left secondary school this year (2025) and pursuing subjects that I actually like at A-Level - as opposed to subjects which were mandatory (such as English Language & Literature) - one quickly realises that writing is no longer an over-analytical burden or just some words on a page, but rather a way to capture thoughts, convey emotions, and share heavily nuanced perspectives.

What I am trying to say is that it is more fun to create *your own* texts with *your own* nuanced perspectives and deeper meaning, rather than having to analyse the somewhat complex perspectives of others.

This is just the start of why I might begin to justify having an entire blog posting section on my website.

Although this website is primarily aimed towards my professional side of Computer Science, you may occasionally find me posting about many different subjects which concern economics, government policy / politics in general, and even more. I will not suppress myself from speaking just because it does not align with the goals of my website.
