# 1.1.2 Positive and Normative Economics

There are two types of investigations in Economics. Both of these can influence economic decision making and policy.

## Positive

The scientific or objective study.

- Can be proven true or false, and
- can be supported or refuted by evidence.

For example, *"UK unemployment is 4.4%"* - this is a positive statement as this can be validated with information from the ONS.

## Normative

Concerned with value judgements, and subjective.

- Cannot necessarily be proven true or false
- Often simply reflects the opinions of others, potentially without factual basis

### Examples

- *"The government **should** increase spending on education"*

> This is a very vague statement. Why should they increase spending? Would it provide any benefits? Any data suggesting bad education, therefore we should increase spending? etc.

- *"It is unfair for the government to reduce state benefits to the unemployed."*

> How is it unfair? Is there economic data to potentially show how reducing state benefits may increase deprivation? etc.
