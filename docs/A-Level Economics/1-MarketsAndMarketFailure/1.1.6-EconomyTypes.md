# 1.1.6 Free, Command, and Mixed Economies

Any [economy](../Keywords/Economy.md) seeks to solve the Basic Economic Problem (BEP) of scarce resources and unlimited wants.

If an economy were to ask questions:

- What is to be produced?
- How?
- And for whom?

[Economic agents](../Keywords/EconomicAgent.md) are **interdependent**, meaning that an action taken by one group has an effect on others.

## Free Market Economy

A **free market** attempts to solve the BEP with *as little* intervention from the government as possible.

## Command Economy

A **command economy** is one where the state and its **central planners** make most of the decisions regarding resource allocation.

## Mixed Economy

A **mixed economy**, as the name suggests, is a mix between the two types, where resource allocation is determined by both the state ***and*** the market forces of supply and demand.

## Example: Economic Spectrum

If you know a bit about the history of the USSR (e.g., think GCSE History Cold War) and especially its economic policies, in addition to the economic policies of modern day Russia, then this spectrum will actually be interesting for you.
