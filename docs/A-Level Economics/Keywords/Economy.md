# *Economy*

Something that tries to solve the [Basic Economic Problem (BEP)](../1.%20Markets%20and%20Market%20Failure/1.1.3-BEP.md).

## Explanation

There are many different types and levels of economy.

<!-- TODO: add hyperlinks to free market, command and mixed economy in BEP page -->

The three main examples of a type of economy would be a [**free market**][freemarket] economy, [**command**][command] economy and a [**mixed**][mixed] economy.

A few examples for levels may be a **household**, **local**, **national**, or **international / global** economy.
