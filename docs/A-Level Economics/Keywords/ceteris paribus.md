# *ceteris paribus*

*(Latin)*: All other things remain unchanged.

## Usage Example

*"An increase in price leads to a fall in demand, assuming ceteris paribus."*

## Explanation

This is a latin expression meaning "all other things remain unchanged", and this may arguably be the most important phrase in Economics, as we love to assume that other factors (e.g. income) stay the same to make observations easier.
