Welcome to the repository for my personal and professional website. It is hosted at <https://richy.lol> and it aims to completely replace my old website which was built with legacy website builder software which was a pain to use. Additionally it also introduces a nice blogging system using MkDocs which is much more convenient for a programmer for me to use - since it is all done with Git.

Apart from the above paragraph, there is not much more information about this repository.
